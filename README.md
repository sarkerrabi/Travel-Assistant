# Travel-Assistant
Travel assistant is featured on Mapbox to assist explorers to have an easy experience with their travelling hobbies or people to go to their destination within an institution easily. The app uses smartphone sensors to create and help in the navigation of users. And using crowdsourcing and IoT, it offers two unique features

1. Creation and sharing of route paths for the user -- allowing one to wander around the remote places without being afraid of getting lost

2. Creation and sharing of surface maps by the verified user (infrastructure owner) -- gives more details and realistic views of infrastructures allowing users to go to the desired location as easy as possible

Together the mapping experience offered by the app is unique as it shows environment condition change with movement with colour-coding to help users understanding the path condition like change in altitude. Also, it is not focused on any particular group of people or country and therefore all can use it and taste the real happiness of travelling without having the tension of any kind
